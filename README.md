Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software in a structured way. It’s important because it ensures software is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968 NATO Conference: First defined "software engineering" as a discipline.
1970s Structured Programming: Introduced better coding practices to reduce errors.
2001 Agile Manifesto: Shifted focus to flexible, iterative development.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Define goals and requirements.

Design – Create system architecture.

Development – Write the code.

Testing – Check for bugs.

Deployment – Release the software.

Maintenance – Fix issues and update.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Linear, step-by-step. Good for projects with clear, unchanging requirements.

Agile: Flexible, iterative. Best for projects needing frequent updates (e.g., mobile apps).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes and debugs code.

QA Engineer: Tests software for bugs.

Project Manager: Oversees timelines and team coordination.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs : Help write, debug, and run code efficiently.

VCS : Tracks code changes, allowing teamwork without conflicts.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Buggy Code → Write tests and review code.

Changing Requirements → Use Agile methods.

Team Miscommunication → Hold regular meetings.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Checking small code parts .

Integration Testing: Testing how modules work together.

System Testing: Examining the whole system.

Acceptance Testing: Ensuring the software meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 It is the crafting clear, effective inputs (prompts) to get better responses from AI models like ChatGPT. It’s important because good prompts lead to more accurate and useful answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Bad Prompt: "Tell me about cars." (Too vague)

Improved Prompt: "Explain how electric cars work in simple terms, focusing on battery technology."
Why Better? It’s specific, clear, and guides the AI model to a precise answer.
